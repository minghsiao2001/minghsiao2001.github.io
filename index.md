## About Me
I am a research assistant at [NCTS](https://ncts.ntu.edu.tw/people_detail.php?gid=465&bgid=8) now, with my mentor [Yng-Ing Lee](https://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/en/entity_people/entity_people/21459). Before that, I completed my master's degree in the Department of Mathematics at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in June 2025.
## Research Interests
I am now enjoying differential geometry, geometric analysis, and metric geometry. My main research interest is geometry flows and their topological applications, especially Ricci flow. During my bachelor's degree, I also studied free probability theory and random matrix theory and discovered some achievements.
## CV
