## About Me
My name is Ming Hsiao, and I am a second-year master's in the Department of Mathematics at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). My advisor is Professor [Yng-Ing Lee](https://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/en/entity_people/entity_people/21459). After this semester, I will serve as a research assistant at [NCTS](https://ncts.ntu.edu.tw/index.php). 
## Research Interests
I am now enjoying differential geometry, geometric analysis, and metric geometry. My main research interest is geometry flows and their topological applications, especially Ricci flow. During my bachelor's degree, I also studied free probability theory and random matrix theory and discovered some achievements.
## CV
This is my [CV](/CV.p).
